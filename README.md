![Titanic](titanic.jpg)

## üö¢ Introduction
Welcome to the Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster project! In this project, we aim to predict the survival of passengers aboard the famous Titanic ship using machine learning techniques. This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and modeling process.

## üìö Libraries Required
To run the notebook successfully, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly

You can install them using pip with the following command:
- pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


## üöÄ How to Use this Notebook
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook or open the folder in VSCode

4. Open the "Titanic_Machine_Learning.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.
5. Follow the step-by-step instructions and execute the code cells to reproduce the analysis and predictions.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Additional Details
- The "titanic_dataset" folder contains the dataset used for analysis ("train.csv" and "test.csv").
- The notebook includes data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- The trained model is saved as "titanic_model.pkl" for future use.
- Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the notebook to improve the predictions.
